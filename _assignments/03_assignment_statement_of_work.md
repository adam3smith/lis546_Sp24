## Assignment: Project definition, scope, and audience
Your first assignment will be to write a group definition and statement of work. This should include the following elements:

- Group name
- Group members
- The topic of your curation protocol (e.g. transportation data)
- The target audience for your protocol (e.g. who would use or consult your protocol)
- Write a three to five sentence statement about your collective goals for the protocol (e.g. what do you want to work on and learn about through the activity)
- Provide a link to any relevant data sources you have identified.
- As always, there'll be a [Canvas discussion](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1724350/discussion_topics/8861700) to post your answers. That said, as you start thinking about how and where to work and/or collaborate on your project, you may decide to post the statment of work there (say, in a GitHub repository) and just provide a link in Canvas.
