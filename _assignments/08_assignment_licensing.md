## Assignment: Data Licensing

**Licenses**      
Open data requires a declaration that the information objects (as provided by an individual or institution) are free for consumption, reuse, and/ or repurposing. Licenses further allow us to protect data creators and data stewards by being explicit about the expectations we have for how data should be used, repurposed, etc.

There are a number of licenses available - each allowing you to achieve different protections for data creators or data stewards.

Below are a small set of resources that describe data licenses and how to make choices between licenses:
- data.gov's commentary on [open licenses](https://resources.data.gov/open-licenses/)
- Cornell Library's [IP rights for data management](https://data.research.cornell.edu/content/intellectual-property) (See in particular their distinction between databases and data)
- [Data.World's guide to open licenses](https://docs.data.world/en/214274-common-license-types-for-datasets.html)

**Implications for your protocol**

Here are the basic questions you should answer in this section of your protocol:
- What licenses will you attach to a dataset, and why? (If your data is already under a license you might explain that here)
- Will you make any exceptions?
- Post a link to the licensing section of your protocol on the [canvas forum](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1724350/discussion_topics/8959910)

If you are interested in a primer on data licensing you might consult the following:
