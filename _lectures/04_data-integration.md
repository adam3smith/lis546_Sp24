**Required Readings:**  
- [Course Content]({{ site.baseurl }}/content/data-integration.html)

**Highly Recommended Readings:**
- [Whong, Chris (2020) “Taming the MTA’s Unruly Turnstile Data”](https://medium.com/qri-io/taming-the-mtas-unruly-turnstile-data-c945f5f96ba0)
- [Wikipedia article on data integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integration)

**Optional Readings:**
Data integration doesn't just apply to quantitative data. This piece on secondary analysis of qualitative data touches on many points discussed above
- [Kern, F. G., & Mustasilta, K. (2023). Beyond Replication: Secondary Qualitative Data Analysis in Political Science. Comparative Political Studies, 56(8), 1224-1256. https://doi.org/10.1177/00104140221139388](https://doi.org/10.1177/00104140221139388)

If you are interested in the history of this topic from the perspective of databases I also highly recommend the following:

- [Halevy, A., Rajaraman, A., & Ordille, J. (2006, September). Data integration: The teenage years. In Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases (pp. 9-16). PDF](https://www.cin.ufpe.br/~if696/referencias/integracao/_Data_Integration-The_Teenage_Years.pdf)

For a bit of historical background, Ch 1 of this book (pages 1-13) provides an excellent overview of how data were originally made compliant with web standards:
