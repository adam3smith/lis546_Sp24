## Readings

### Required Readings
From an ongoing research project at the iSchool, this is a rich discussion of the complex ethics and politics of Indigenous data, written accessibly enough to simulataneously serve as a good introduction.
Belarde-Lewis, M., Littletree, S., Braine, I. R., Srader, K., & Palmer, C. (2024). [Centering Relationality and CARE for Stewardship of Indigenous Research Data. SocArXiv. https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k2j47](https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k2j47)

I found this chapter from _Data Feminism_ especially relevant for thinking about curating data, taking into account different perspectives:
Dâ€™Ignazio, C., & Klein, L. F. (2020).[ Data Feminism: Chater 5: Unicorns, Janitors, Ninjas, Wizards, and Rock Stars. The MIT Press. https://doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/11805.003.0007](https://doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/11805.003.0007)


### Suggested Readings
This modern classic isn't relevant here in its entirety so I'm not requiring for this class, but if you have not read it yet, consider it a quasi-requirement. You can't graduate from iSchool (certainly not at UW) without having read this. It does end with a plea for the careful curation of datasets for machine learning.
Bender, E. M., Gebru, T., McMillan-Major, A., & Shmitchell, S. (2021). [On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big? ðŸ¦œ. Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency, 610â€“623. https://doi.org/10.1145/3442188.3445922](https://doi.org/10.1145/3442188.3445922)


I learned a lot about Indigenous/decolonizing perspectives on ontologies from this piece, co-authored by iSchool professor Miranda Belarde-Lewis
Duarte, M. E., & Belarde-Lewis, M. (2015). [Imagining: Creating Spaces for Indigenous Ontologies. Cataloging & Classification Quarterly, 53(5â€“6), 677â€“702. https://doi.org/10.1080/01639374.2015.1018396](https://doi.org/10.1080/01639374.2015.1018396)

There is not a lot of literature about data curation and disability, so if you're interested in the topic, my (Karcher's) co-authored piece is a good place to start
ColÃ³n, R. D., Goben, A., & Karcher, S. (2023). [Actually Accessible Data: An Update and a Call to Action. Journal of Librarianship and Scholarly Communication, 11(1), Article 1. https://doi.org/10.31274/jlsc.15449](https://doi.org/10.31274/jlsc.15449)
